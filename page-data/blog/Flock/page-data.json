The First, for all, State of Fedora by Matthew Miller, our FPL.</p>\n<p>One was the workshop of the design team about badge project: Designing Fedora Badges. After an initial overview about the project, the admins Maria Leonova and Marie Nordin have explained that how the badges are done. Then they show how to take a badge and how we work on this. After a do-session on the badge selected, I pushed my work to review by design team and this is approved.

In this talk they have explained a different point of view about the Fedora Project's organization. </p>\n<p>In the future this will upset the current settings to allow better coordination and better communication between outreach teams to obtain a better results.

In this workshop we have explained how we communicate, what type of tools we use, how we use a local build to test the websites before submitting a pull request and how you can join us. After an overview on this project, we have guided the attendees to set up their system and take an issue opened on pagure. In the end, we have obtained some pull request to fix also important issue. So I would to thanks all attendees and I hope that they will join our team.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to thank the Fedora Project for giving me the opportunity to participate in this fantastic experience.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"That's all...
